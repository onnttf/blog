However, many people have become accustomed to using short passwords, such as `space`.\r\n\r\nThis article provides a solution for those who wish to keep using short passwords.\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Clear the password policy\r\n\r\nOpen the `Terminal` application and type the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npwpolicy -clearaccountpolicies\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter pressing `Enter`, you will be prompted to enter the current password. It's important to note that the password you type is not visible. Simply press `Enter` when you have finished typing.\r\n\r\n![image](https://file.onnttf.site/2024/1/30/2.png)\r\n\r\nWhen the `Terminal` displays \"Clearing global account policies\", it will indicate that the password policy has been successfully cleared, as shown below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://file.onnttf.site/2024/1/30/3.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Change your password\r\n\r\nTo change your password, click on the Apple logo in the top left corner of the screen, select **System Preferences** > **Users & Groups** and follow the on-screen instructions.\r\n\r\n![image](https://file.onnttf.site/2024/1/30/4.png)\r\n\r\nYou can find that there are no password requirements during this process.\r\n\r\nBy following these steps, users can bypass the enforced password restrictions and use short passwords, such as `space`.\r\n","number":33,"labels":{"nodes":[]},"category":{"id":"DIC_kwDONzrbkM4Cmnbf","name":"Show and tell","slug":"show-and-tell","emoji":":raised_hands:","emojiHTML":"<div>ðŸ™Œ</div>"},"author":{"login":"onnttf"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","createdAt":"2024-01-30T16:22:37Z","updatedAt":"2025-02-05T11:55:57Z","repository":{"id":"R_kgDONzrbkA","url":"https://github.com/onnttf/blog"},"url":"https://github.com/onnttf/blog/discussions/33","jsonFilePath":"discussions/33-D_kwDONzrbkM4AeNcK.json","markdownFilePath":"2024/1/33-D_kwDONzrbkM4AeNcK.md"}
